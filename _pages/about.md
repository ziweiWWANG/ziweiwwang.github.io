I am a PhD student in the <a target="_blank" href="https://cecs.anu.edu.au/">College of Engineering and Computer Science (CECS)<a/> at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.anu.edu.au/">Australian National University (ANU)<a/>. I am also a research student at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roboticvision.org/">Australian Centre for Robotic Vision (ACRV)<a/>.

I am under the supervision of <a target="_blank" href="https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~Robert.Mahony/">Prof. Robert Mahony<a/> (ANU), <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DeHsa3wAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Yonhon Ng<a/> (ANU) and <a target="_blank" href="https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~nmb/">Prof. Nick Barnes<a/> (ANU).

Prior to that, in December 2019, I received my bachelor degree of engineering in mechatronic systems with a first-class honours in the College of Engineering and Computer Science at ANU. In 2018-2019, I was also a summer research intern at the <a target="_blank" href="https://cecs.anu.edu.au/study/more-information/summer-research-program"> ANU College of Engineering & Computer Science <a/>, working on image processing and simulation.

I have a broad research interests in computer vision, natural language processing and robotics. Currently, my main research focus is on the problem of **Embodied Vision-and-Language (E-V&L)**, and inparticular Vision-and-Language Navigation . I believe, E-V&L has the great potential to merge a wide range of visiolinguistic research to create an embodied interative system which is practical to assist human in real-world.
